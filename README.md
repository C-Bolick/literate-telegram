USER STORY

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples.
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a goof canidate for an open poistion.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first applications
THEN that applicant's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a reposive layout that adapts to my viewpoint

This week's challenge was to create our own portfolio from scratch. I was following this tutorial but it became too advance for me.
(https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-portfolio-website-using-html-css-javascript/)

So I went back and looked at some old html and copied the text from there.
NOTE: I didn't change some elements because everytime I did I broke the page.

The pics of the dogs are my (annoying) dogs; Stella, Peach, Scout (Top:Bottom).
The other two pictures were googled images.
